Note: this was made in about 10 minutes so is pretty hacky and not robust.<br>
It depends on:
- [jquery](https://code.jquery.com/)
- [bililiteRange](https://github.com/dwachss/bililiteRange)
- [jquery.sendkeys](https://github.com/dwachss/bililiteRange/blob/master/jquery.sendkeys.js)

For the time being, I've just dumped all these dependencies in the file `dep.js`.

How to Run:
1. open web.whatsapp.com
2. select the chat you want to target
3. Paste the contents of `dep.js` into the console
4. Then paste the contents of `arithmetic.js`
5. You can minimise the window, etc as long as you keep your phone connected
